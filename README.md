TachyBase Fiddle lets you quickly create and experiment with lightweight applications powered by the TachyBase engine.
Upon launch, it presents you with a quick-start template — you can modify a few things, choose the version of the engine to use, and start experimenting right away.

TachyBase Fiddle supports loading the TachyBase engine, managing plugins, and running TachyBase applications directly on the desktop. It’s the ideal tool for developers to explore and prototype within the TachyBase ecosystem.
